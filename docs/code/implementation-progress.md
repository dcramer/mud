## Implementation Order (Recommended)

Based on dependencies and core functionality:

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Complete BaseSystem tests
2. 📋 Create System Manager
3. 📋 Design database schema
4. 📋 Implement basic Command System

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. 📋 Character creation and persistence
2. 📋 Room/Location system
3. 📋 Basic movement commands
4. 📋 Look command implementation

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. ⏳ Combat system foundation
2. ⏳ Basic essence system
3. ⏳ Simple NPCs and dialogue
4. ⏳ Initial world areas

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None

### Upcoming Risks
1. **Database Schema Design** - Critical to get right early
2. **Command Parser Architecture** - Affects all future commands
3. **Network Protocol Design** - Need to finalize WebSocket message format

---

## Next Actions

1. Complete BaseSystem test implementation
2. Create SystemManager to coordinate all systems
3. Design initial database schema for:
   - Players/Characters
   - Rooms/Areas
   - Items
   - Game state
4. Implement CommandRegistry and CommandExecutor
5. Create first working command: "look"
