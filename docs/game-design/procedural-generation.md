# Procedural Generation Systems

This document outlines how we use AI and algorithms to create dynamic content including NPCs, dungeons, quests, and abilities.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Guided Randomness** - AI provides variety within designed constraints
- **Narrative Coherence** - Generated content must make sense in context
- **Emergent Gameplay** - Simple rules create complex interactions
- **Player Discovery** - Ensure there's always something new to find
- **Quality Control** - AI suggestions filtered through design rules

## NPC Generation

### Personality Matrix

NPCs are generated using multiple overlapping systems:

#### Core Personality Traits
- **Temperament** (Aggressive ↔ Peaceful)
- **Sociability** (Hermit ↔ Gregarious)
- **Morality** (Corrupt ↔ Virtuous)
- **Ambition** (Content ↔ Driven)
- **Intelligence** (Simple ↔ Genius)

#### Background Generation
1. **Origin Story** - Where they came from
2. **Defining Event** - What shaped them
3. **Current Motivation** - What drives them
4. **Secret/Flaw** - Hidden depth
5. **Relationships** - Connections to others

#### Dynamic Dialogue
- AI generates contextual responses
- Personality traits influence tone
- Memory of past interactions
- Faction relationships affect attitude
- Procedural quest hooks based on needs

### NPC Archetypes

#### Merchants
```
Generation Parameters:
- Specialty goods (essence-related)
- Pricing personality (fair/greedy/generous)
- Secret inventory conditions
- Regional knowledge
- Trade route connections
```

#### Quest Givers
```
Generation Parameters:
- Problem type (personal/regional/cosmic)
- Reward preferences
- Complication tendency
- Success/failure reactions
- Follow-up quest chains
```

#### Faction Representatives
```
Generation Parameters:
- Loyalty level to faction
- Personal vs faction goals
- Corruption possibilities
- Information access level
- Recruitment approaches
```

## Quest Generation

### Quest Building Blocks

#### Objectives
Primary objectives selected from templates:
- **Kill** - Eliminate specific targets
- **Collect** - Gather items or resources
- **Deliver** - Transport goods or messages
- **Investigate** - Uncover information
- **Survive** - Endure for duration
- **Protect** - Defend person/place/thing

#### Complications
Added dynamically to increase interest:
- **Time Limit** - Adds urgency
- **Rival Party** - Competition element
- **Double Cross** - Betrayal subplot
- **Hidden Truth** - Not what it seems
- **Moral Dilemma** - No perfect solution
- **Resource Scarcity** - Limited supplies

#### Contextual Generation
Quests consider:
- Player's current rank and abilities
- Local area conflicts and politics
- Recent player actions/reputation
- Party composition and size
- Time of day/season/events

### Quest Chain System

#### Procedural Storytelling
1. **Inciting Incident** - Generated based on area
2. **Escalation** - Each quest raises stakes
3. **Revelation** - Hidden connections revealed
4. **Climax** - Major confrontation/decision
5. **Resolution** - Consequences play out

#### Branching Paths
- Player choices affect next quest
- Multiple valid solutions
- Failure creates new opportunities
- Side quests spawn from main chain
- Faction reputation influences options

## Dungeon Generation

### Architectural Styles

#### Room-Based Generation
```
Algorithm:
1. Generate room purposes (combat/puzzle/treasure/boss)
2. Create room connections ensuring path to end
3. Add secret passages and shortcuts
4. Place encounters based on difficulty curve
5. Populate with theme-appropriate details
```

#### Organic Caverns
```
Algorithm:
1. Cellular automata for natural shapes
2. Ensure connectivity with pathfinding
3. Add environmental hazards
4. Create creature ecosystems
5. Place resources logically
```

#### Structured Complexes
```
Algorithm:
1. Define architectural purpose
2. Generate logical floor plans
3. Add defensive positions
4. Create maintenance areas
5. Include living quarters
```

### Encounter Placement

#### Difficulty Scaling
- Entry areas: Tutorial encounters
- Main paths: Steady progression
- Side areas: Risk/reward balance
- Secret areas: Extreme challenges
- Boss rooms: Climactic battles

#### Environmental Storytelling
Generated details that tell a story:
- Battle damage showing past conflicts
- Personal belongings suggesting inhabitants
- Architectural decay indicating age
- Magical residue from experiments
- Escape routes implying paranoia

### Loot Generation

#### Contextual Rewards
- Monster-appropriate materials
- Environment-suitable items
- Rank-scaled equipment
- Essence/awakening stone chances
- Unique procedural items

#### Treasure Quality
```
Factors:
- Dungeon difficulty rating
- Completion thoroughness
- First discovery bonus
- Party performance metrics
- Active event modifiers
```

## Ability Generation

### Essence Combination System

When creating new abilities from essence combinations:

#### Thematic Blending
```python
Example: Fire + Swift =
- "Flame Dash" - Teleport leaving fire trail
- "Accelerating Inferno" - Damage increases with movement
- "Phoenix Rush" - Speed burst with healing
- "Wildfire Pace" - Spread effects while moving
```

#### Mechanical Innovation
- Combine base mechanics uniquely
- Add conditional triggers
- Create resource interactions
- Build combo potential
- Balance risk/reward

### Awakening Stone Results

#### Ability Generation Factors
1. **Essence Synergy** - How well essences work together
2. **Character History** - Past actions influence results
3. **Current Needs** - Slight bias toward useful abilities
4. **Rarity Modifiers** - Higher rarity = more unique mechanics
5. **Divine Influence** - Faction standing affects outcomes

#### Procedural Ability Examples

**Common Result**:
```
"Stone Skin"
- Effect: +20 armor for 30 seconds
- Cooldown: 60 seconds
- Mana Cost: Low
- Essence: Earth
```

**Legendary Result**:
```
"Terraforming Apocalypse"
- Effect: Reshape battlefield terrain
- Secondary: Enemies adapt or take damage
- Cooldown: Once per day
- Mana Cost: Extreme
- Essence: Earth + Cataclysm confluence
```

## Spell Variation System

### Base Spell Modification

Each spell can have procedural variants:

#### Elemental Variants
- Fire: Damage over time, spreading
- Ice: Slowing, freezing solid
- Lightning: Chain effects, paralysis
- Earth: Knockback, armor
- Shadow: Blindness, teleportation

#### Behavioral Modifiers
- **Seeking** - Homes toward targets
- **Piercing** - Goes through enemies
- **Splitting** - Divides on impact
- **Returning** - Boomerang effect
- **Lingering** - Creates hazard zones

## World Event Generation

### Dynamic Events

#### Trigger Conditions
- Player population in area
- Resource depletion rates
- Faction reputation thresholds
- Calendar/seasonal timing
- Random world state checks

#### Event Types

**Monster Migration**:
```
