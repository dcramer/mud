# Core Game Systems

This document outlines the fundamental game systems inspired by "He Who Fights With Monsters".

## Essence System

The essence system forms the foundation of character abilities and progression.

### Overview
- Characters can bond with up to **4 essences**
- Each essence provides up to **5 abilities** (20 total possible)
- First ability awakens automatically upon bonding
- Additional abilities require **Awakening Stones**
- Three essences combine to form a **Confluence Essence** (4th essence)

### Essence Rarity
1. **Common** - Basic essences with straightforward abilities
2. **Uncommon** - Slightly more specialized abilities
3. **Rare** - More powerful and focused abilities
4. **Epic** - Highly specialized abilities
5. **Legendary** - Unique and powerful abilities

### Essence Categories
- **Physical Essences**: Tangible concepts (Fire, Water, Iron, Plant)
- **Concept Essences**: Abstract qualities (Balance, Growth, Renewal, Might)
- **Restricted Essences**: Banned or controlled (Death, Corrupt, Undeath)

### Confluence Essences
When a character bonds three essences, they automatically receive a confluence essence based on the combination:
- Example: Dark + Blood + Sin = Doom
- Some combinations produce restricted confluences
- Confluence determines overall character archetype

## Ranking System

Characters progress through ranks, each providing significant increases in power and lifespan.

| Rank | Category | Life Expectancy | Requirements | Special Features |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Normal | 0 | ~60 years | No essences | Base human capabilities |
| Iron | 1 | ~75 years | All 4 essence slots filled | Begin magical transformation |
| Bronze | 2 | ~100 years | All 20 abilities unlocked | Significant power increase |
| Silver | 3 | ~200 years | All abilities at Silver rank | Enhanced physical capabilities |
| Gold | 4 | ~500 years | Essence revelations required | No breathing needed |
| Diamond | 5 | Ageless | Extreme dedication | Body reconstitution |
| Transcendent | 6 | Immortal | Special circumstances | Divine level |

### Rank Progression Mechanics
- Abilities progress individually through ranks
- Must advance all abilities to progress character rank
- Higher ranks require exponentially more time/effort
- Gold+ ranks need "essence revelations" for advancement

## Attributes

Four core attributes define character capabilities:

### Power
- Physical strength and force application
- Meta-weight (resistance to knockback/displacement)
- Affects melee damage and physical abilities
- Enhanced by essences like Might, Earth, Bear

### Speed
- Movement speed and reaction time
- Flexibility and dexterity
- Dodge and evasion capabilities
- Enhanced by essences like Wind, Swift, Shadow

### Spirit
- Mental fortitude and magical power
- Mana pool size
- Essence ability effectiveness
- Enhanced by essences like Magic, Mind, Soul

### Recovery
- Health regeneration rate
- Mana regeneration rate
- Stamina recovery
- Affliction resistance and duration
- Enhanced by essences like Life, Renewal, Phoenix

### Attribute Bonding
- Each essence bonds to one attribute
- Using abilities increases the bonded attribute
- Balanced progression encourages using all abilities
- Racial bonuses provide starting advantages

## Awakening Stones

Awakening stones unlock essence abilities beyond the first.

### Rarity Tiers
- **Common**: Broad ability pool, general effects
- **Uncommon**: More focused abilities
- **Rare**: Specialized abilities, higher power
- **Epic**: Unique mechanics, powerful effects
- **Legendary**: Game-changing abilities

### Ability Determination
Abilities from awakening stones are influenced by:
1. **Race** - Racial affinities affect outcomes
2. **Existing Essences** - Synergies between essences
3. **Known Skills** - Ritual magic knowledge, combat training
4. **Previously Awakened Abilities** - Creates ability chains
5. **Personality Traits** - Character's nature affects results
6. **Current Needs** - Slight bias toward useful abilities

### Awakening Process
1. Perform awakening ritual with stone
2. System generates ability based on factors
3. Ability permanently bound to character
4. Cannot be changed or removed
5. Failed rituals destroy the stone

## Racial Abilities

Each race provides unique advantages and abilities.

### Racial Gifts
- 6 racial abilities per race
- Can evolve through experiences
- Provide passive bonuses and active abilities
- Influence essence ability outcomes

### Gift Evolution
Racial gifts can evolve through:
1. **Intense Events** - Surviving deadly encounters
2. **Persistent Habits** - Long-term behavior patterns
3. **Divine Blessings** - Favor from gods/astral beings
4. **Rank Advancement** - Natural evolution at higher ranks

## Design Principles

### Balance Through Diversity
- No essence inherently superior
- Power comes from synergy and creativity
- Player skill matters more than essence rarity

### Meaningful Choices
- Essence selection defines playstyle
- Awakening stones create unique builds
- Cannot respec - choices are permanent

### Long-term Progression
- Years-long journey to high ranks
- Always something to work toward
- Prestige from rare combinations
