# Tutorial System

## Overview

The tutorial system in our MUD is designed to introduce players to complex mechanics gradually while respecting the "old-school difficulty" philosophy. Rather than hand-holding, it provides essential knowledge and then lets players experiment and discover on their own.

## Tutorial Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Teach Essentials Only**: Cover only what's needed to survive initial gameplay
2. **Learn by Doing**: Practical exercises over lengthy explanations
3. **Optional Depth**: Advanced tutorials available but not required
4. **Respect Player Intelligence**: Assume players can figure things out
5. **Quick to Complete**: Get players into the real game fast

### What We DON'T Do
- Force players through lengthy tutorials
- Lock features behind tutorial completion
- Treat players like they've never played a game
- Explain every minor mechanic
- Prevent experimentation or "wrong" choices
