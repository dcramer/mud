# Character Progression Mechanics

This document details the hybrid progression system that combines active gameplay rewards with idle/offline progression inspired by idle RPGs.

## Overview

Our progression system blends idle RPG mechanics with active gameplay rewards. This creates a system where:
- Players progress through offline training in selected activities
- Active play provides significantly faster progression
- Strategic planning of offline activities is rewarded
- No player can "grind" impossibly far ahead
- Time is a valuable resource that must be allocated wisely

## Offline Training System

### Training Selection
Players can select ONE activity to train while offline:
- **Combat Training** - Practice against training dummies
- **Resource Gathering** - Mine, chop wood, fish, or forage
- **Crafting Practice** - Work on crafting skills
- **Ability Meditation** - Slowly advance essence abilities
- **Knowledge Study** - Research lore and theories
- **Social Activities** - Build NPC relationships

### Offline Progression Rates
- Offline training provides **10-20%** of active play rates
- Maximum offline duration: **12 hours** (requires planning)
- Resources still consumed during offline training
- Can queue different activities for consecutive periods

### Training Speed
Base training speed is determined by:
1. **Attribute Match** - Skills train faster with higher related attributes

## Idle Mechanics Philosophy

### Respect for Time
- Offline progress ensures no time is "wasted"
- Players can maintain progression with busy schedules
- Strategic planning replaces constant grinding
- Progress continues during work, sleep, or life events

- Different builds benefit from different training
- Market opportunities from offline gathering

### Preventing Burnout
