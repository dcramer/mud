# Death and Recovery Mechanics

This document details what happens when characters die, resurrection options, and the penalties for death at different ranks.

## Death States

### Health Depletion
When health reaches 0:
1. **Unconscious State** (0 HP)
   - Character collapses, unable to act
   - 3-minute window for rescue
   - Can be healed back to consciousness
   - Taking damage risks permanent death

2. **Death's Door** (-10 HP)
   - Critical state requiring immediate aid
   - Special abilities needed to stabilize
   - 1-minute window before death
   - Each hit accelerates timer

3. **True Death** (-25 HP or timer expires)
   - Character dies and becomes a spirit
   - Must seek resurrection
   - Items remain on corpse
   - Corpse location marked on map

### Instant Death
Certain effects bypass unconscious state:
- Massive overkill damage (3x max HP)
- Execution abilities
- Environmental hazards (lava, void)
- Specific boss mechanics
- PvP finishing moves

## Spirit Form

### Spirit Mechanics
Upon death, you become a spirit:
- **Invisible** to most players
- **Intangible** - can't interact with world
- **Swift Movement** - 2x movement speed
- **Spirit Sight** - see other spirits
- **Limited Communication** - spirit speak only

### Spirit Abilities
- `spirit walk` - Move through walls
- `spirit recall` - Return to nearest temple
- `haunt [location]` - Bind to area temporarily

- Iron Rank: 30 minutes
- Bronze Rank: 20 minutes

- Gold Rank: 10 minutes
- Diamond Rank: 5 minutes
