# Weather and Time System

## Overview

The weather and time system creates a dynamic, living world where environmental conditions affect gameplay, magic density influences danger levels, and dimensional spaces operate under their own rules. Rather than purely cosmetic changes, weather and time create meaningful gameplay variations and strategic considerations.

## Time System

### World Time

#### Day/Night Cycle
- **Duration**: 4 real-world hours = 1 game day (2 hours day, 2 hours night)
- **Transitions**: 30-minute dawn/dusk periods with gradual changes
- **Time Display**: In-game clock showing current time and phase

#### Time System Implications
**Important**: The accelerated time affects in-game events but NOT real-world timers:
- **Game Time**: NPC schedules, shop hours, day/night bonuses
- **Real Time**: Daily login bonuses, event durations, ability cooldowns
- **Example**: A shop that's "open during the day" is open for 2 real hours out of every 4

#### Time Phases
1. **Dawn** (5:00 - 6:00)
   - Reduced monster spawns
   - Morning mist effects
   - Gradual visibility improvement
   - Dawn-specific rituals enabled

2. **Day** (6:00 - 18:00)
   - Full visibility
   - Normal activity levels
   - Markets and shops open
   - Standard monster behavior

3. **Dusk** (18:00 - 19:00)
   - Increasing shadow density
   - Nocturnal creatures awakening
   - Visibility reduction beginning
   - Dusk-specific events

4. **Night** (19:00 - 5:00)
   - Reduced visibility (without light sources)
   - Increased monster spawns
   - Shadow abilities enhanced
   - Night markets in some areas

### Calendar System

#### Months and Seasons
- **12 Months**: Each 30 days long
- **4 Seasons**: 3 months each
  - **Spring**: Renewal, growth events
  - **Summer**: Heat effects, festivals
  - **Autumn**: Harvest, preparation
  - **Winter**: Cold, scarcity

#### Special Days

### Dimensional Time

#### Astral Space Time
- **Variable Flow**: Time can move differently in astral spaces
- **Controlled Domains**: Astral kings can manipulate time flow

- **Temporal Anchors**: Items that sync time with outside world

#### Spirit Domain Time
